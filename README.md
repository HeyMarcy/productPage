# Product Page Code Challenge
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The only additional dependency is `node-sass`.

[View the deployed site](https://nostalgic-tesla-5df87c.netlify.com/).
## Intent:
##### Branch: `stepOne-ui`
My approach here is to present an initial version of the UI layer. With the exception of this `READ ME` all the work was completed within 2 hours. 
**Missing items include: the header, breadcrumbs, star-rating icons and an icon in the footer area.**

##### Branch: `stepTwo-props`
This is the first iteration of the application. Created a json file to hold product data. Data is passed as props. Created button list component.

### Usage

Just fork or clone this repository, run `yarn` and you should be ready to go.

- **Development:**
  `yarn start` will run a development server with hot reloading at <localhost:1234>
- **Production:**
  `yarn build` will bundle everything up on your `/dist` folder

### To-Dos:
- [ ] Add responsive header.
- [ ] Add 'emotion' and refactor components to include styles.

# Product Page Code Challenge
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The only additional dependency is `node-sass`.

[View the deployed site](https://nostalgic-tesla-5df87c.netlify.com/).

### Usage

Just fork or clone this repository, run `yarn` and you should be ready to go.

- **Development:**
  `yarn start` will run a development server with hot reloading at <localhost:1234>
- **Production:**
  `yarn build` will bundle everything up on your `/dist` folder

## Intent and To Dos:
My approach here is to present an initial version of the UI layer. With the exception of this `READ ME` all the work was completed within 2 hours. 
**Missing items included: the header, breadcrumbs, star-rating icons and an icon in the footer area.+*

### To-Dos:
- Add responsive header
- Add 'emotion' and refactor components to include styles.
- Create a state object for the product page. This would include description text, price, the available colors and sizes.
- Create button list component. Refactor to map the colors or sizes.
- Create style for disabled buttons (and disable the 'M' size button).
- Create hover and selected styles for buttons.
- Adjust and refine vertical rythm.
